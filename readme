# Nvidia Financial Strategy: R&D Expansion Analysis 🚀

### 📊 Project Overview
**"Should Nvidia spend $700M to hire 2,000 more engineers?"**

As an FP&A Analyst, I built this model to answer that specific business question. Using real public data, I modeled the impact of a massive headcount expansion on Nvidia's Operating Margins.

**The Goal:** Determine the "Revenue Break-Even" point—how much new sales do we need so this investment doesn't hurt our profitability?

### 🧠 The Core Decision
* **The Investment:** $700 Million (2,000 hires @ $350k/year).
* **The Constraint:** We must maintain Nvidia's historical Operating Margin profile (60%+).
* **The Outcome:** My analysis shows this investment is **Low Risk**.

### 📸 Key Insights

#### 1. The Margin Impact
Even with a $700M spend, our margins remain robust as long as we hit the "Base Case."

#### 2. ROI & Break-Even
We only need $1B in new revenue to break even. In the "Bull Case," this investment generates 4x ROI.

### 🛠️ How It Works
I structured the analysis into three clear components:
1.  **Historicals:** Baseline data from Nvidia's 10-Q.
2.  **Inputs:** Variable toggles for Headcount Growth and Avg. Salary.
3.  **Scenarios:** A dynamic look at "Bear", "Base", and "Bull" outcomes.
